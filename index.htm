			<p>This site is here to give a little history about the MLB American League Central Division.
			as well as some information on the upcoming 2013 season. I chose the central division for the sole
			reason that I am a Minnesota Twins fan through and through! So enjoy some baseball!</p>
			<h2>History</h2>
			<p>In 1994 the Central Division was created in the realignment of the entire Major League.
			The Royals, Whitesox and the Twins came from the West Division and the Indinas and Brewers came from
			the East Division. In 1998 with the addition of the Devil Rays, the league was realigned again and the
			Brewers moved to the NL East and the Tigers moved into the AL Central Division. This is now the current
			layout of the Division. And what most fans dont know is that the AL Central is the only division where
			each of its members has won the World Series at least once!</p>
